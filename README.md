# Loom Marketing Engineer Interview

Welcome to the Loom Marketing Engineer interview scaffold! Before we hop on a call, here's
the gist:

1. `src` contains your React app bundled by [parceljs](https://parceljs.org/)
2. `server.js` is a lightweight [express.js](https://expressjs.com/) scaffold
3. By default the express server is on port `3000` and serves the [app on its root](http://localhost:3000/).
4. The client code can already make REST calls to the server.

## Setup

1. Ensure you have `node` and `npm` (or `yarn`) installed on your machine.
2. Make sure you're on Node 12 or `nvm use`
3. `npm install` or `yarn install`

## Run

`npm run start` or `yarn start`

## Ensuring You're Good to Go

1. Hit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser and make sure you can see the default UI.

## What we are not looking for

1. Your React knowledge.
2. Your Express knowledge.

## What we're cool with

1. Starting from scratch and using static HTML and CSS
2. You installing your own frontend framework of choice
3. Use an online IDE like [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/)
